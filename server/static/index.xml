      <description>During the summer semester we had to create an implementation of bilinear interpolation, which is commonly used in image processing. It&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to mess up the indices or numeric calculations in Assembly, so naturally we ran into some bugs here and there.

      <description>I recently wanted to update my keyboards layout and thought it was a good opportunity to come with a guide since many friends keep asking me how to flash their keyboard on Linux. In this case I am requiring an Atmel-based PCB as we’re using DFU-Programmer which is developed for Atmel-Microcontrollers.</description>
