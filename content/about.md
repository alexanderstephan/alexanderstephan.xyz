## Projects {#MEDIUM}

### [Snake Clone Built for the Terminal Using goncurses](https://github.com/alexanderstephan/gobra){#MEDIUM}

Wanted to learn `golang` and `ncurses`. This is the result. Enjoyed this project a lot since C libraries interface with golang really nicely.

### [Self Driving Robot With Readily Available Parts](https://github.com/alexanderstephan/edubot){#MEDIUM}

I had to develop a robot for my former school and document my experiences and assembly in a paper. Even with the limitation of the cheap ultra sonic sensors, obstacle detection is reasonably good.

### [Nixie Clock with Integrated Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/alexanderstephan/coronixie) {#MEDIUM}

I got a couple Nixie tubes from my grandpa, so I decided to build the ever so popular Nixie clock. I tought myself how to use KiCAD and created the PCB layouts. Once again I tried to aim for readily available parts and sizes that are suited for etching PCBs at home.

### [Dotfiles](https://github.com/alexanderstephan/dotfiles){#MEDIUM}

Over the years I fiddled around with a lot of configs in Linux and macOS, so unevitably I also had to create a dotfiles repository. This primarily a personal backup, butfeel free to use it with your own setup or at least take inspiration from it.
