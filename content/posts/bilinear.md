During the summer semester we had to create an implementation of bilinear interpolation, which is commonly used in image processing.
It's quite easy to mess up the indices or numeric calculations in Assembly, so naturally we ran into some bugs here and there.
For that reason the intermediate results were quite amusing, I wanted to share them here in a little gallery. Enjoy!
