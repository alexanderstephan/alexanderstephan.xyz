      <title>Installing Syncthing alongside Nextcloud</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a self-hosted solution for my Nextcloud for quite some time now. I always felt like the performance was not up to par, especially on my lower end devices. My MacBook almost reached 100% CPU usage just by using the synchronization tool from the official Nextcloud client. This does not usually appear to a problem, but in my particular scenario, I have to synchronize a lot of small files due to very fragmented project structures, which seem very demanding for the indexing algorithm.</description>

      <description>During the summer semester we had to create an implementation of bilinear interpolation, which is commonly used in image processing. It&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to mess up the indices or numeric calculations in Assembly, so naturally we ran into some bugs here and there. For that reason the intermediate results were quite amusing, I wanted to share them here in a little gallery. Enjoy!

      <description>I recently wanted to update my keyboards layout and thought it was a good opportunity to come with a guide since many friends keep asking me how to flash their keyboard on Linux. In this case I am requiring an Atmel-based PCB as we’re using DFU-Programmer which is developed for Atmel-Microcontrollers. But there is a good chance, that you have one in your keyboard as well since they are the most popular manufacturer for microcontrollers.</description>
