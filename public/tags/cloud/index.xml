      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a self-hosted solution for my Nextcloud for quite some time now. I always felt like the performance was not up to par, especially on my lower end devices. My MacBook almost reached 100% CPU usage just by using the synchronization tool from the official Nextcloud client. This does not usually appear to a problem, but in my particular scenario, I have to synchronize a lot of small files due to very fragmented project structures, which seem very demanding for the indexing algorithm.</description>
