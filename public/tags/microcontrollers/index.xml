      <description>I recently wanted to update my keyboards layout and thought it was a good opportunity to come with a guide since many friends keep asking me how to flash their keyboard on Linux. In this case I am requiring an Atmel-based PCB as weâ€™re using DFU-Programmer which is developed for Atmel-Microcontrollers. But there is a good chance, that you have one in your keyboard as well since they are the most popular manufacturer for microcontrollers.</description>
